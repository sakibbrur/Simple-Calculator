This a very simple calculator with separate header files

The files can be compiled by linux(Ubuntu) terminal using this command:
"g++ main.cpp add.cpp sub.cpp mul.cpp div.cpp square_root.cpp -o output" without quotion.
Then my new executed file name will be "output.out".

And to see the output in Linux(Ubuntu) terminal the command: 
"./output " without quotation.
